            <p>Census Reporter is an independent project to make data from the American Community Survey (<abbr title="American Community Survey">ACS</abbr>) easier to use. We are unaffiliated with the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>
            <p>
                A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151207075007/http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/six-ventures-bring-data-public-winners-knight-news/">News Challenge grant from the <strong>Knight Foundation</strong></a> funded
                the initial build-out of the site. <strong>Joe Germuska</strong> developed the grant proposal and is the project lead. Our original project advisory board consisted of <strong>Joe Germuska</strong>, <strong>John Keefe</strong>, and <strong>Ryan Pitts</strong>.
                We are grateful to <a href="https://ire.org"><strong>Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE)</strong></a>, who served as the fiscal agent for our original grant funds. After the original grant was spent, we incorporated as Census Reporter,
                NFP, an Illinois not-for-profit corporation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Sara Schnadt</strong> served as the original designer and community coordinator. <strong>Ryan Pitts</strong> and <strong>Ian Dees</strong> were the primary software development team. <strong>Joe Germuska</strong> served as project
                manager and wrangler, and, with <strong>John Keefe</strong>, contributed to project design and planning.
            </p>
            <p>

        <h2>About the Data</h2>
        <p>Data presented in Census Reporter is collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. In general, the data is from the most recently released American Community Survey (<abbr title="American Community Survey">ACS</abbr>).
        </p>
        
        <p>At this time, the data is from the <strong>2018-2022 5-year ACS</strong> and the <strong>2022 1-year ACS</strong>. In general, 1-year ACS data is released in September of the year following its collection, and the 5-year ACS data is released in December. See the <a href="https://www.cenhttps://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/news/data-releases.html">ACS data releases page</a> for more information.</p>
        
        <p>Census Reporter does not currently offer any access to past data. We recommend <a href="data.census.gov">data.census.gov</a> or <a href="https://www.ipums.org/">ipums.org</a> for those who need data from earlier ACS releases or other Census data products.</p>

        <p>Our <a href="{% url '2020' %}">2020 Census Data for Your Neighborhood</a> service is built on data from the 2020 Decennial Census redistricting data release.</p>
